    <P>Maze Runner: The Death Cure (also known simply as The Death Cure) is a 2018 American dystopian science fiction film directed by Wes Ball and with a screenplay by T. S. Nowlin, based on the 2011 novel The Death Cure written by James Dashner. It is the sequel to the 2015 film Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials and the third and final installment in the Maze Runner film series. Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Patricia Clarkson, Ki Hong Lee, Dexter Darden, 
        Giancarlo Esposito, Aidan Gillen, Barry Pepper, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jacob Lofland, Katherine McNamara, Rosa Salazar, and Will Poulter reprise their roles from the previous films with Walton Goggins 
        joining the cast.
        Maze Runner: The Death Cure was originally
         set to be released on February 17, 2017, in the United States by 
         20th Century Fox, but the studio rescheduled the film's release for 
         January 26, 2018, allowing time for O'Brien to recover from injuries 
         he sustained during filming. The film received mixed reviews from 
         critics with praise for the cast performances, action sequences and 
         visual effects but criticism for the storyline, screenplay and 
         character development. The film grossed over $288 million worldwide.</P>
